# MediBuddy Health Insurance Analysis – Capstone Project

This repository contains my capstone project focused on analyzing and predicting health insurance claims using real-world datasets from MediBuddy. The goal was to explore how personal health and demographic factors influence the insurance claim amounts and to set the foundation for a machine learning model.

## 📁 Datasets Used:
1. **Personal Details Dataset:** Includes features like Age, BMI, Gender, Smoking Status, Number of Children, and Region.
2. **Insurance Price Dataset:** Contains the amount spent per policy cover.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
In this phase, I explored:
- Impact of gender and smoking on claim amount
- Influence of location and number of dependents
- BMI and age relationships with claim costs

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies:
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
